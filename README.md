# Float Point Addition Alg
I created this C program to help me understand adding Float Point numbers.

This program take in 32 bits, then splits it up taking the first bit as the sign of the mantissa, the next eight as the exponent and then the last 23 bits as the mantissa.
It evaluates it with an algorithm, then outputs it the normalized binary Float Point.

*I am still working on checking for overflows and underflows.
